Hello World
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a series of examples showing the basics of how write coroutines and
schedule them in the asyncio event loop.

1. Simple coroutine

Example using the :meth:`BaseEventLoop.run_until_complete` method to schedule
simple function that will wait one second, print 'hello' and then finish.

Because it is launched with `run_until_complete`, the event loop itself
with terminate once the coroutine is completed.

2. Creating tasks

This second example show how you can schedule multiple coroutines in the
event loop, and then run the event loop.

Notice that this example will print 'second_hello' before 'first_hello',
as the second task scheduled waits longer that the first one before printing.

Also note that this example will never terminate, as the loop is asked to
`run_forever`.

3. Stopping the loop

This third example adds another task that will stop the event loop before
all scheduled tasks could execute, which results in a warning.

.. literalinclude:: examples/stop_loop.py

| Task was destroyed but it is pending!
|Â task: <Task pending coro=<say() done, defined at examples/loop_stop.py:3> wait_for=<Future pending cb=[Task._wakeup()]>>
